## Photo Sharing App
This is the repository for the Photo Sharing App we will be building using Firebase.

### Problem Statement
The idea is to build a rather simple app, not complex in any way and not fancy at all (We are a group of beginners) for the ALC 2.o groups challenge that we are having.

The app uses Firebase for authentication (Login with Google) and Firebase Storage option to store the images that users will be sharing.
